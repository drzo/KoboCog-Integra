# KoboldAI-OpenCog Integration Project ## Project Overview
Create middleware to integrate KoboldAI storytelling platform with OpenCog AtomSpace to build a scalable narrative generation system as StorySpace.

## Core Requirements 1. Connect KoboldAI's storytelling engine with OpenCog's knowledge representation 2. Enable multi-world narrative management 3. Implement character relationship tracking 4. Create quest/goal management system 5. Support concurrent story orchestration ## Technical Specifications ### KoboldAI Integration - Utilize KoboldAI's API for story generation - Implement memory and world-info management - Support multiple AI models - Enable save/load functionality ### OpenCog AtomSpace Integration - Design knowledge graph schema for narratives - Implement relationship mapping - Create world state tracking - Enable probabilistic inference ### Middleware Components 1. Story State Manager 2. Character Relationship Tracker 3. World Event Orchestrator 4. Quest Logic Engine 5. Narrative Consistency Validator ### Data Structures - Story Graphs - Character Networks - World State Trees - Quest Dependency Maps - Event Timelines ## Expected Deliverables 1. API documentation 2. Integration architecture 3. Core middleware components 4. Testing framework 5. Performance metrics ## Technical Constraints - Scalability to 1000+ concurrent narratives - Real-time story updates - Memory-efficient state management - Consistent narrative logic
